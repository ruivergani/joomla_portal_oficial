Website for Institute Campus Machado using Joomla!

## 💻 About

Website for Institute Campus Machado using Joomla (CMS). With the help of a development environment, from a template developed by the Joomla! Calango, changes were made seeking to adapt the basic model to the real needs of the Machado campus website, without, however, changing the visual identity established by the Federal Government. These changes were supervised by the communication team, who suggested the inclusion of new elements within the page, with the aim of better organizing the website's content.
